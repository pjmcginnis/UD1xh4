        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>believe, we must(I meane) say, I be

        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Some unlearned there are which hold  
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>opinion that in this point of our con 
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>fession we should say, I believe in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>holy Church. The reason that leades  
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>them so to thinke is this, because they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>finde written in the Constantinopli
        <lb ed="#L" n="39" break="no"/>tane Creede, And in the holy Ghost the

        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>from the father &amp; the sonne who toge

        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>worshipped and glorified, who spake
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>by the Prophetes in one Catholiqu,
        <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>and Apostolique Church. For these  
        <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>wordes they doe so distinguishe that  
        <!--78.xml-->
        <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
        <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>as they doe repeate out of the <unclear>premises</unclear>  
        <lb ed="#L" n="48"/> these wordes, I believe, and make  
        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>this the sense, I believe in the holie

        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>believe in one Catholique and Apo

        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>than needeth, yea and against all god 
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>linesse doe they wrest these wordes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>of the Creede. For this, In one Ca 
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>tholique and Apostolique Church, is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>not referred to the Verbe, I believe,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>but to the holy Ghost, because hee

        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>For our meaning is, and we confesse  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>that one and the same spirite did all

        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>that by nature, and our owne proper

        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>have two excellent examples of men o 
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>penly confessing their sins to God, the

        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>for the merit and bloud of the sonne of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>God : not for our owne workes or me 
        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>rites, but for the truth and mercie or  
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>grace of God. For we do plainely pro

        <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>givenesse of sins, but I believe the for 
        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>givenesse of sinnes. And the worde re 
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>mission or forgivenesse doth signifie a  
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>free pardoning, by a metaphore taken

        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>In this sense also, saith S. Paul: <quote xml:id="UD1xh4-SJPiPd-Qd1e1101">To

        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>vident testimonies of the holy Scrip 
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>ture. Jonas is swallowed up of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>Whale in the Syrian sea, but the 3. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>day after hee is cast up againe alive  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>uppon the shoare out of the beastes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>entrailes, which is a token, that the

        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>Wherefore that is not hard to be be 
        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>leeved, that in the Apocalips is saide, ye  
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>The Sea casteth uppe her dead. The  
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>force of fire had no force to hurt the

        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>First glory in this sense is used for  
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>a lightsomnesse and shining bright 
        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>nesse. For Paul saith, that the children 
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>of Israel for the glory of Moses coun 
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>tenance, coulde not beholde with their  
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>eies the face of Moses : so then a glo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>rious body is a bright and shining bo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>dy. A very good proofe of this did our  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>Lord shew, even a little before his re 
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>surrection, whe it pleased him to give 
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>to his Disciples a small taste of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>glory to come, and for that cause took a 
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>side certaine whom he had chosen into  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>the top of a certaine hil, where he was 
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>transfigured before them, so that the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>fashion of his countenance did shine as  
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>the sunne, and his clothes were white  
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>&amp; glittered as the light. The Lord veri 
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>ly had stil the same bodily substance, &amp;  
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>the same members of the body, but 
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>they were transfigured.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>But it is manifest, that that transfi 
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>guratio was in ye accidents: For light  
        <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>and brightnesse was added, so that the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>shape &amp; substance of the countenaunce  
        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>and bodie remayning as it was, the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>countenaunce and body did glitter as  
        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the Sunne &amp; the light. And although  
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>wee reade not, that the bodye of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>Lord did within those 40. daies, wher

        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>and that by reason of the dispensation,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>whereby also he did eate with his dis

        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>bodies neede not foode or nourishment

        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>also shall in the resurrection bee like

        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>in the Gospell alleadging the wordes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>of <ref>Daniel</ref>, saith: <quote>Then shall the righ 
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>teous shine as the Sonne in his fathers 
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>kingdome.</quote> For this cause the glori 
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>ous bodies are called also clarified of

      <p>
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>Secondarily, glorie and vilenesse

        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>Glorie, are set the one agaynst the o 
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>ther. Vilenesse comprehendeth the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>whole packe of miseries and infirmi 
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>ties, passions and affections, which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>for sinne was layde uppon the bodie,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>From all which our bodies are pur 
        <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>ged in the resurrection of life: so that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>then the glorious bodies are bodies  
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>dreined from the dregges of all cor 
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>ruption, passions and infirmities, and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>clad with eternitie, heavenlie feeling  
        <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>and glorie. For the <ref>Apostle</ref> saith: <quote>It is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>sowen in corruption, itriseth in in 
        <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>corruption: it is sowen in dishonour,

        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>is a naturalll bodye, and there is a spiri

        <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>plainely he sayth: <quote>Howbeit that is not 
        <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>first which is spirituall, but that which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>is naturall, and then that which is spy 
        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>rituall. The first man is of the earth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>earthly:the second man is the Lord from  
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>heaven. As is the earthly, suth are they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>that are earthly: fas is the heavenly,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>suth are they also that are heavenlie,
